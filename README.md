# About me

- Repository: `about-me`
- Type of Challenge: `learning`
- Duration: `1 day`
- Team challenge: `solo`
- Deployment strategy: `netlify` or `Github pages`

## Learning Objectives

Whether you've just finished SoloLearn or it's been some time ago, let's put it into practise!
After today, you'll know everyone a bit better and refreshed your HTML/CSS skills.
Are you ready to share add your embarrassing stories to your page? 😏

## The Mission

You'll create a page to get us to know you.
Every page will link to the next student, so one can click through the whole class.
## 🌱 Must haves

### Phase 1: content

1. Create a page and make sure you have the following content

> Your Name (as a large header)
>
> An inspirational quote in _italics_
>
> A (professional) photo of yourself (you can save the file in the repository next to the README file)
>
> "Me, in one sentence" (as a smaller header)
>
> A table with the following structure:
>
> ---
>
> Birthday: dd/mm  
> Favorite color: ?  
> Favorite food: ?  
> Pineapple on pizza: Yes/No (Extra challenge: make it look like a (un)checked checkbox)
>
> ---
>
> Hobbies (smaller header)
>
> _This should contain a bullet list of your hobbies_  
> _At least on item should contain a sublist, for example if you like movies, maybe make a sublist of some movies you really like._
>
> You can always count on me when... (smaller header)
>
> _Tell your teammates which positive contribution to the group you will make._  
> _This could be technical, making people feel comfortable, being an organiser..._
>
> A funny story (smaller header)
>
> _Tell a short funny story about your life._
>
> TL;DR (even smaller header, under funny story)
>
> _Summarise your funny story in one short sentence._

### Phase 2: styling

Add some CSS to tweak the styling to your liking.

### Phase 3: putting it online

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) provides a simple drag & drop interface to host simple HTML/CSS website.
Create an account and host yours.

### Phase 4: next / previous

Add the links to the previous and next person in class, so we can click through the full group.
What order, you ask? I'm not going to imply one, so that for all of you to decide / arrange.

> The links should have the following structure:
>
> << previous || YOUR NAME || next >>
## 🌼 Nice to haves (doable)

Oh wow, you even have some time to spare? Try your hand at these options:

- Check who in your group might need your help. Can you give them a push in the right direction, without completely taking over?
- Add a few images to set the atmosphere or to support your story

## 🌳 Nice to haves (hard)

> Note: this isn't easy, and mostly meant for those with prior experience.

How does your page look on smaller screens, or your phones?
If you already know the basics about `responsive development`, try to apply those techniques here to improve the styling on small screens.

## Congrats!

There, you've just finished one of your first BeCode exercises.
